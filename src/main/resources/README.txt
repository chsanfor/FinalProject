Welcome to /*GAME NAME*/!

WHAT IS IT?
----------
GAME NAME is an application that allows users to launch projectiles by inputting an angle. The program uses this angle and the gravity of the location
in order to calculate a flight trajectory for a projectile. Points are awarded by hitting debris with the projectile.

The purpose of this program is to teach familiarity with angles and how gravity might affect a flight path.
